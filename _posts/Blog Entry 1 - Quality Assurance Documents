As I have now created my blog, I will keep this blog updated with information about tasks that I have completed. These blogs will either be once a week or will be updated after certain tasks have been completed.

To start off the group project, I volunteered to read the first three Quality Assurance Documents. (SE.QA.01, SE.QA.02 and SE.QA.03). This included the information about Quality Assurance Plan, Documentation Standards, Project Management Standards. As these documents provided a lot of information for quality standards, I decided to summarise these points in Word documents. These documents still include all the siginifcant information that needs to be considered, but is presented a different layout so it is easier to read. It is also easier to find which section you require as each document contains a different section (e.g. Meeting minutes or Documention requirements etc.) instead of reading through a large document to find what you require.
